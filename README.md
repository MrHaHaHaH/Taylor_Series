# Recent Development and Analysis of Taylor Series
Final Year Project (FYP)

## Project Overview
Titled 'Recent Development and Analysis of Taylor Series,' my FYP is structured into three phases: 
 
**(1) Proposal**  
**(2) Progress Report**  
**(3) Final Report**  

## Project Scope
My primary task involves sourcing recent academic materials like journals and research papers related to the Taylor series. Following this, I analyze these materials and execute calculations, simplifications, and graphical representations of Taylor series equations. Leveraging Matlab as my primary tool, I aim to produce comprehensive and visually concise results by employing it for calculation, simplification, and graph plotting of Taylor series equations.
