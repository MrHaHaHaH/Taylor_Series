# Recent Development and Analysis of Taylor Series
Final Year Project (FYP)


## Project Overview
Titled 'Recent Development and Analysis of Taylor Series,' my FYP is structured across three key phases: 
**(1) Proposal**  
**(2) Progress Report**  
**(3) Final Report**  


## Project Scope
My primary objective revolves around gathering recent academic literature, such as journals and research papers, relating to the Taylor series. Subsequently, I analyze these materials, conducting calculations, simplifications, and graphical representations of Taylor series equations. By leveraging Matlab as my primary tool, I'm focused on generating comprehensive and visually lucid results, utilizing its capabilities for calculation, simplification, and graph plotting related to Taylor series equations.
